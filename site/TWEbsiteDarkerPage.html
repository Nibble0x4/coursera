	<p class="text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> The Darker Race </b>
	<br>A race that hails from beneath the ground and, even further, from beyond the veil that separates worlds. Darkers are a race of small dark creatures marked indelibly by an 
	irrepressible desire to survive and to thrive, despite the trials they face around every corner. They are adaptable and resilient, refusing to lay down and die.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:48px"> History </b>
	<br> The Darkers are a new race from an old world. Hailing from a land beyond That Which Exists, the Darkers fled their world in an attempt to escape the tyranny they had slaved under for generations. Scorned and hunted as beasts, they fled worlds and arrived in That Which Exists ragged and forlorn. They had hoped to find solace and rest, but were instead greeted with suspicion, outrage, and hunting of a scale previously unheard of. They were only a couple hundred strong when they arrived, and less than a quarter of their number survived the purge that followed. In desperation, they fled to the mountains of Gruss, land of the monsters. The humans ceased to follow them, assuming they would be killed by the beasts of the untamable Wilds. The Darkers were run to exhaustion, all but giving up hope on survival in a harsh world, when they were saved. The ground upon which they stood seemed to fall away, moving them from the harsh sunlight to a cool, damp, silent corridor beneath the earth. They wandered, terrified, through the endless pitch-black corridors. The eldest of their number was soon met by an undeniable presence in his mind. This presence spoke to the Darker elder, reassuring him that his people would now be safe. This being had no voice, and yet called itself the Catacombs. Rejoicing in the calm, cool, safe body of their savior, the Darkers were led to a vast canyon within the depths of the Catacombs. There they remain, protected and instructed by the ageless wisdom of the great being in which they live. Most are content but some, known as Zealots, bear grudges against the creatures of the surface, plotting in anticipation of the day they can resurface and show the world that the Darkers are not to be trifled with.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:48px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> The Darkers have the form and appearance of small elves, with sharp ears and sleek, frail, angular features that some may even consider beautiful. Their skin and hair is pitch-black in its entirety, with no hint of light or color anywhere but their small, perfectly spherical eyes. These eyes have dark grey instead of white, but that is rarely seen as their massively enlarged pupils take up most of their eyes. These pupils have a variety of colors, ranging from purple to yellow to red. Darkers once had claws and vicious fangs for clawing and biting prey, but these traits have been suppressed in their attempt to live a peaceful life. The fangs of a Darker are equipped to inject a paralytic venom into their prey, but this poison has long since lost its potency and the claws of the typical Darker more closely resemble dainty fingernails than dangerous claws. The average male Darker stands at 3’ 6”, with females averaging 3’2”.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:48px"> Culture </b>
		<br> The history of the Darkers is full of pain and loss. However, the race is resilient, and strives to avoid depression and resentment at all costs. However, even their optimism has its limits. Due to their origin as mindless drones of a bloodthirsty and unforgiving queen, they are fiercely protective of their individuality and free thought. Anything that appears to threaten either of those things is met with immediate distrust and even violence.  Despite this individuality, their society is built upon seamless teamwork. They are a cautious race, being burned for their trust in the past, they now prefer to error on the safe side. In most cases, Darkers strive to keep their identity and even their existence a secret to outsiders. The bodies of Darkers, while small, are readily adaptable to training. As a result, Darker children are raised to fulfill one of two societal roles, a nurturer or a defender. Nurturer males and females have families and reproduce swiftly, often raising between 5 and 10 children per family. Nurturers with particularly bright minds are used as historians, researchers, or scientists. The greatest of these researchers is chosen by the Catacombs as the next Darker Elder, and is trained specifically for their job as the one who communes with their god. Darker Defenders are trained to be swift and silent, tactical and brave. Darkers are weak, small, and frail, but the defenders are raised to defy these limitations and spend their lives as the wall that protects their nurturing families. These Darkers hone their bodies and minds to be quick, enduring, and one with the corridors of their home. They are granted the ability to manipulate the ooze that constantly coats the surface of the Catacombs, using it to disguise their true forms, move swiftly through the corridors, frighten opponents, evade attacks, and even, if it is necessary, strike out against those who invade their home.
		<br><br> Darkers are a swiftly populating race, living and dying quickly and learning even more quickly. On average, Darkers mature at 10 years old and die at 45.
