	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> Many stories are told of the Fearthites, at least amongst those willing to discuss them. The very existence of these creatures is a source of unease for many of the residents of Taria, as they offer a disturbing insight to the possible future of mankind itself. But amongst those who speak of them, the imaginations run wild. Some say they originated from the earth itself, Mother Earth’s failed attempt to start a new, superior humanity. Others say that the Fearthites truly are human, but have devolved through generations of self-imposed exile from civilized society. Still others worry that the Fearthites are fey creatures evolving to challenge and one day usurp the human race as the dominant species. Some paranoid theorists even believe that the Fearthites are already among us, slowly taking key positions in our world in order to orchestrate our inevitable subjugation. Whatever the truth may be, the true answer to the history of this strange race is carefully kept within their number...or so they’d like you to think. Truthfully, they themselves have long since forgotten.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Fearthites reflect the vibrant, colorful, and fluctuating nature of the jungles and swamps they call home. Fearthites can range in height greatly, with the females tending towards the taller end and the males typically comprising the smaller. Their skin tends to be green, but are filled with a variety of colorful lines or patterns that help them blend surprisingly well into their home territories. The hair of a Fearthite is difficult to distinguish as well, as it carries strange hues and exists as hair mixed with leaves and twigs and even feathers. The males and females of the species vary greatly in appearance, the typical female averaging 7 feet in height, while males average a mere 3 feet. Similarly, the slender physique of the female is opposed by the short and scruffy form of the male. While females tend to resemble the vines and tall plants of their jungle homes, males tend to grow “hair” on their bodies and faces that are more rough to the touch, giving a distinct “bush” impression. This allows them to remain hidden lower to the ground. If this amount of variety wasn’t enough, however, the Fearthites have a limited shapeshifting capacity. The females can extend their slender limbs like vines, and males use their natural scruff as defensive spines. Fearthites eschew complicated garments like armor or fancy clothing. In fact, they wear very little in the way of apparel aside from the bare necessities and any stylizing touches such as feather accessories or colorful grass skirts. Their skin is perfect for camouflage, so they see little reason to cover up. All these are generalities, of course, since finding two identical Fearthites is like finding two identical snowflakes.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Contrary to common belief, the Fearthites want nothing to do with conquering humanity. Far from it. While their wild and savage appearance and admittedly animalistic tendencies cause them to seem threatening, they are content with their place in the world. The jungles and swamps of southern Taria are a dangerous and inhospitable place. Humanity stays out for convenience and self-preservation, and the Fearthites would like it to remain that way. While not necessarily hostile towards humans, they are wary and untrusting of humanity as a race. For most, this manifests as an avoidance and a monitoring of humans who enter their domain, while others range from violent ambushers to secret sympathizers who are fascinated with the strange foreigners. Rarely, though not entirely unheard of, Fearthites have set off from their home to see the outside world. These adventurers rarely go too far, and their sightings are always met with suspicion. Fearthites are intelligent creatures and do form society, but they rarely construct much in the way of shelter or anything humans would consider a town. They live separate from each other as atomic families, with a single family usually occupying a region of jungle instead of a house. Fearthites are heavily independent creatures with little mind or patience for government. They can speak, but rarely do. They have mastered a beautifully complex and sophisticated language that rarely involves uttering a single sound. Body language, sign language, eye contact, the slightest facial expressions, and even what type of foliage they currently sport as clothing or tools are all a part of their silent communication. Some say they can even speak to each other when out of sight by slightly altering the path of the wind as it passes by their bodies.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Fearthites. Many of these will have differing options depending on whether your Fearthite is male or female.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> <u>Females:</u>  Females are tall, slender, and smooth creatures. They gain a +2 to a chosen mental score (int, wis, or cha), +2 dex, -3 con, and -1 str.
		<br><br> <u>Male:</u>  Males are short, stocky, bramble-cpvered creatures. They gain +2 wis, +2 con, -2 cha, and -1 dex.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> <u>Females:</u>  35 feet
		<br> <u>Males:</u>  25 feet

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> <u>Females:</u>  Medium creatures
		<br> <u>Males:</u>  Small creatures and thus gain +1 on attack rolls and AC, as well as a +4 size bonus to stealth, but a -1 penalty on CMB and CMD.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Racial Traits </b>
		<br> <u>Females:</u>  +2 on escape artist checks due to their slender forms.
		<br><br> <u>Males:</u>  +1 natural armor bonus due to their scruffy forms.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Skill Traits </b>
		<br> All Darkers are immune to shadow effects and gain a +2 bonus to saving throws to disbelieve illusions.
		<br> <u>Nurturers:</u>  +2 diplomacy
		<br> Researcher: In addition to the Nurturer Bonus, gain access to knowledge (planes, engineering, dungeoneering), +2 climb, +2 acrobatics
		<br> Parent/Historian: In addition to the Nurturer Bonus, gain Perfect Recall.
		<br><br> <u>Defender:</u>  +2 survival, +2 stealth, +2 disguise

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Languages </b>
		<br>  A Fearthite begins play knowing the Fearthite Secret Language. Fearthites with a high intelligence (12 or higher) can choose to learn Tarian or Common.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Weakness Traits </b>
		<br> The Fearthites are creatures of wood. As a result, they gain:
		<br> Vulnerability(x2) to fire.
		<br> A penalty to stealth and disguise, based on the surroundings.
		<br> <u>Weak Lungs:</u>  Fearthites rarely use their voices. As a result, their lungs are underdeveloped. Their voices are typically as loud as a nearly-silent whisper.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Attunement Traits </b>
		<br> <i>(these traits are lost if the Fearthite is wearing any armor at all, or any clothing other than that which is made purely from natural materials stuck together.)</i>

		<br><u>Weapon Use:</u> Fearthites are masters of using whatever natural tools they should happen across. A stick of wood or other natural plant life can be morphed and used as a weapon of a similar type. For example, a small stick could be morphed into a natural dagger. These makeshift weapons function precisely as their human counterparts, but are fragile and useful only to Fearthites. At level 10, a Fearthite gains the ability to form +1 masterwork weapons in this way.
		<br><u>Poison Potency:</u> +2 racial bonus to the DCs of poisons created.
		<br><u>Photosynthetic Restoration:</u> For every hour that a Fearthite spends immobile in the sunlight, they regain 1 hp per level. They can also choose to store this energy (up to 1/2 their max hp) and release it later  once per day for healing in a pinch. This energy can be used to heal the self or another Fearthite when expelled by way of a hug or some other full-body contact. If energy is stored and released this way, all unused stored energy is lost and no more can be stored that day (though more healing can be gained by remaining immobile in sunlight). Any stored energy is lost at a rate of 1 hp per minute once the Fearthite is in an area of low-light or darker. This ability works on stable, unconscious Fearthites as well.
		<br> <u>Females:</u>  Your long limbs channel the spirit of the earth and operate like vines, giving you 15 foot reach.
		<br><br> <u>Males:</u>  Your prickly exterior manifests in thorns coated in a debilitating toxin produced within your body. Any time a creature would make contact with you, you can choose to extend your spikes. They take 1d4+1 damage for every damage dice they roll against you on that attack. A fortitude save (DC=your level) is required or else suffer a sickened 1 debuff. This toxin effect cannot be experienced more than once per turn.
